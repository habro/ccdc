# SECCDC Toolkit
This is a compilation of scripts written/gathered to assist the TN Tech SECCDC Team to automate repetitive tasks to help secure the company's network. Some of these scripts are gathered from other sources and are stated at the top of the file who the author is and where it was taken from. We are not claiming said scripts as our own, just compiling them into a single source to better locate the scripts.
